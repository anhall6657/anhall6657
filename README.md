- 👋 Hi, I’m @anhall6657
- 🌱 I’m a biologist by training, specializing in genetics, genomics, and microbiology.
- 🎓 I have a PhD in Molecular and Cellular Biology from the University of Washington.
- 👀 I’m interested in building a portfolio of custom bioinformatics tools and workflows.
- 💞️ A problem I'm interested in solving is in genome annotation: Even with the most up-to-date annotation tools, many genomes are full of hypothetical proteins and genes of unknown function. I'm working to enhance these annotations for a more holistic understanding of a genome's potential, especially regarding metabolic pathways.
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm a competitive ballroom dancer! 💃
